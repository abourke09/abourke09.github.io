									<h2>React and Redux Project Reflection</h2>
									<p>A game to help people make choices, built with React and Redux</p>
								</header>
								<img src="/images/plush-design-studio2.jpg" alt="" />
								<p><h4><strong>Concept and Game Flow</h4></strong> My project concept is an web app that allows users to make decisions
									in a group using a “Draw Staws” technique. A good use case would be a group of roommates
									deciding who has to do which chores in a home. In this example, there might be three roommates
									and three different chores- cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the kitchen, and vacuuming the living
									room.</p>

								<p>If they were playing Draw Straws in real life, they might each choose a piece of straw from a
									bundle of straws of varying lengths. The person with the longest piece would get to choose their
									preferred chore first. The person with the second longest straw would then choose from the
									remaining two. The person with the shortest straw would have to take the last remaining chore option.</p>

								<p>In this webapp, the straws of varying length are replaced with a function shuffleDraw(array)
									that randomly shuffles the players and assigns each player their draw order from that random
									shuffle. Once the game name and number of players are set, the player names and options can
									be entered. From there, the players are shuffled and each in turn is given the chance to
									choose their preferred option. Once all of the players have chosen an option, the game is
									saved and redirects to the Game Show page. Aside from the Game Show page, user can also view
									a list of Games, list of Players, and individual Player Show pages.</p>

								<p><h4><strong>API Backend</h4></strong> The game database is written in Ruby on Rails and includes seed data to allow
									 the user to see a few examples upon startup. The API includes three models: game, player,
									 and option. An option belongs to a player and belongs to a game. A game has many options
									 and many players through options. Similarly, a player can have many options and many games
									 through options. The create method in the Games Controller plays an important role when a
									 new game is saved. The createGame action from the frontend fetches a POST request (with new
									 game data) to ‘http://localhost:3001/api/games’ which in turn is directed to the games#create
									 controller action. Redux Thunk middleware allows the request to interact with the API
									 asynchonously, so after the response comes back fromt the API, a dispatch can be sent to
									 the Redux store to update the data there.</p>

								<p><h4><strong>Frontend</h4></strong> The frontend of this web app is written in JavaScript and each component is loaded
									onto the page through the Router set up in the App component. The Home link is a functional
									component that simply displays a welcome message and instructions. The All Players and AllGames
									links route to container components Players and Games respectively. They each contain lists of
									functional components, PlayerCard and GameCard. A user can also view an individual player or
									game by clicking on it- they’d be routed to the appropriate Show page to view more detials
									about it.</p>

								<p>All of the data about players and games is stored in Redux, and that store is first set when
									the App component’s lifecycle method componentDidMount() runs. App is connected to the async
									actions fetchGames and fetchPlayers in two ways- first, by importing them from the actions
									folder, and second, by actually connecting them to the React Redux store upon export. When
									componentDidMount() fires, players are fetched from the API in JSON format and then dispatched
									to the playersReducer to set the Redux state with the incoming data. The same is done for games.</p>

								<p>Later on, when the user is ready to save a new game, a similar process unfolds. As explained
									in the API Backend section, the createGame() action is called in the handleSubmit() function
									in component GameFormFour. This POSTs the new data to the API and then edits the Redux store
									as well.</p>

								<p><h4><strong>Conclusions</h4></strong> Using an API in conjuction with React and Redux is really fun! Together they offer
									a lot of functionality and open up a lot of different possibilities for a web app. It’s been
									really fun to connect a frontend interface with a backend API to start to explore some of
									those possibilities.</p>
