									<h2>Getting Started with Java</h2>
									<p>Key components of Java and a Hello World program</p>
								</header>
								<img src="/images/taylor-vick2.jpg" alt="" />
								<p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages out there, so it’s
								been exciting to dive in and start learning about it. Sun Microsystems
								released Java 1.0 in 1995 and promised developers the ability to “Write
								Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA). In other words, once the java program is
								compiled, it can be used on any platform without needing to recompile-
								Mac, Linux, Windows, Android smartphones, ect. Basically, any device
								that has the Java Virtual Machine installed on it. This was a major step
								for a programming language of the time and was a big part of its
								widespread adoption.</p>

								<p>Java’s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is another hallmark of the
								language. In OOP, everything is an object. It’s necessary to note an
								exception to this though- technically, primitive data types like
								booleans, integers, and chars are non-objects. Java is also class-based,
								so each object is an instance of a class. Each class acts as a blueprint
								for each instance of an object that is a part of it.</p>

								<p>To get started programming with Java, I downloaded the Eclipse IDE for
								Java Developers. From there, I was able to get up and running quickly
								with the help of a YouTube tutorial. Predictably, I started with a
								simple “Hello World” program.</p>

								<code>
									public class MyFirstProgram {
										public static void main(String[] args) {
											System.out.println("Hey World!");
										}
									}
								</code>

								<p>The <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovb8njlzvlA”>Java
								Programming Tutorial</a> I followed along with was by the YouTuber Caleb
								Curry. One of the most helpful parts was his explanation of the
								individual words that made up MyFirstProgram. After coding with Ruby on
								Rails and JavaScript, Java is fortunately pretty ‘“readable” in the
								sense that it’s pretty easy to guess what a line of code is going to do.
								All the same, I still appreciate knowing what all these new keywords are
								doing for my code.</p>

								<p>Class: the class `MyFirstProgram` contains the entirety of this program.
								It is made up of members.   Method: a type of member that does
								something. In this case, we have the method `main`, which prints out
								“Hey World!”.  Property: a type of member that stores something.
								Access Modifier: defines what code can use the method, in this case, our
								code is public.   Static: this means that you don’t have to declare a
								new instance of the class in order to use the method.  Main: the main
								method is executed every time the program MyFirstProgram is run. Every
								program needs a main method.</p>
