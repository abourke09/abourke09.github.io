									<h2>GitHub In Practice</h2>
									<p>Appreciating how GitHub makes a complicated process much, much easier</p>
								</header>
								<img src="/images/zach-reiner2.jpg" alt="" />
								<p>GitHub can seem deceptively simple when everything is going according to plan. After
									learning the basics early on in the Flatiron curriculum, I was able to keep track of my
									repositories, make commits, and share my code fairly easily. It was only when my projects
									started to get more complicated that I remembered just how powerful, and complex, GitHub is.</p>

								<p>Sidenote Although my simple use of GitHub involved only a minimal amount of typing in
									Terminal, I started using the Atom GitHub Package to make the process even easier. The
									provided Git integration makes it extraordinarily easy to write different commit messages
									for changes in different files and even different code blocks within the same file. The
									package also makes it easy to create new branches, switch between branches, and pull/fetch/push
									to the online repository. It’s a great tool that makes it easier to focus on your code instead
									of version control.</p>

								<p>Simply put, GitHub is a version control system. Version control systems (VCS) really shine
									when multiple people are working on the same resource at the same time. They’re also perfect
									for a person who wants to experiment with a resource while knowing that they can always revert
									back to an earlier working version. The key to these use cases is that GitHub allows users to
									integrate changes to a resource in a controlled (and reversible) way.</p>

								<p>GitHub Guides has a great flowchart showing how a team might use GitHub branches to work on
									and collaborate on a repository together. In it, they outline how a team member may create a
									new branch, make a few commits, and then submit a pull request to their colleagues. Those
									colleagues would then be able to review all of the commits made on the new branch and suggest
									changes before ultimately merging the new branch with the master branch.</p>

								<p>Ultimately though, this scenario is just one of many that GitHub manages to facilitate. There
									could be multiple branches with pull requests at the same time or users could be working off of
									different copies of the master. The end goal is the same- to retain a working resource in the
									master branch and allow users to contribute in a way that doesn’t cause errors or make someone
									else’s work redundant.</p>

								<p>Fortunately, GitHub has a bunch of resources to help explain some of it’s more complex use
									cases. There’s a nifty cheatsheet of Terminal commands , an e-book, and a whole collection of
									learning resources. It’s nice to know that as teams grow and projects get more complicated,
									GitHub has the capacity to effectively manage every necessary version.</p>
